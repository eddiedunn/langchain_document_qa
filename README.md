This is an example console question and answer app.

It is using pgvector as the vector database. I installed pgvector using Docker https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector
It is also using Hugging Face Instruct Embeddings which are open source and do not use OpenAI's embeddings (thus are free if ran locally)
